# Contributing
Please make sure you run the pre-commit hooks before submitting a PR. To run them, make sure you have [pre-commit installed](https://pre-commit.com/index.html#install), and then clone the repo and run:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

If you've already created a commit, to verify it meets spec, just run:
```bash
pre-commit run
```

Once you've commited any doc changes and bumped the chart version, please feel free to submit a PR :)
